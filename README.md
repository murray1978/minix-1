Official MINIX sources - Automatically replicated from gerrit.minix3.org

## Ideas
 1) Graphics API, not relient on X11
 2 )Have TCL/TK use the graphics API
 3) Have python with tkinter enabled
 4) Move python into tools, write/modifiy Makefiles for minix system, currently have python 1.5.0 working w/o tkinter, crypto, networking
 5)Have USB, USB storeage, USB diagnostics, RTL-SDR working
 6) Audio API
 7) Use python as a front end for app's and interface. (python terminal and Shell as standard)
